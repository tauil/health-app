# HealthApp

## Running the app:
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## You may need to bind the server to 0.0.0.0. If so, do this:

```
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## What's next?

Here are some improvements that could be done with more time.

* DRY - Reduce a lot of repetition in the code
* Add business logic to relationships like Therapists can be assigned to patients that are assigned to his Clinic
* Write tests for the components (There's tests only for the services)
* Write e2e tests
* Create a better interface layout
